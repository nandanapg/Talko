### Project Description
This chatbot is designed to prioritize the safety, credibility, and confidentiality of its users. It automatically erases the conversation data after each use, ensuring that no information is retained once the chat session ends. Only users who have access to the specific link of the bot can join the conversation, preventing unauthorized access. This unique feature guarantees that only the intended participants can engage with the bot, enhancing security.

### The Problem statement
 In today's digital age, privacy and data security are significant concerns for online communication platforms. Many chatbots store user data, which can be vulnerable to unauthorized access and misuse. Additionally, most bots are accessible to anyone with the link, potentially exposing confidential conversations.

### The Solution
 This chatbot addresses these concerns by erasing the conversation history after usage, ensuring that no personal data is stored. It is available exclusively to users who possess the unique access link, preventing unauthorized parties from viewing the conversation, thus guaranteeing a secure and private communication experience
